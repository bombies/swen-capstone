Project Charter
Project Title: Jamaica’s Bridges in Business
Project Date:  January 2025 - June 12, 2025
Problem Identification:
In Jamaica, sole traders such as student entrepreneurs, new ventures, and established small businesses face persistent challenges in promoting their goods and services due to the absence of a centralized platform. This gap forces entrepreneurs to rely on fragmented, inefficient advertising methods  like WhatsApp, Instagram and group chats, which are not designed to support structured commerce, secure payments, or legal compliance. This severely limits their visibility, market reach, and growth potential. The issue disproportionately impacts informal and semi-formal sectors, where limited resources compound the struggle to navigate Jamaica’s regulatory landscape, including tax compliance, business registration, and data privacy laws.
Additionally, many of these small businesses are unfamiliar with the legal and regulatory obligations necessary for running a compliant business. These include proper business registration with the Companies Office of Jamaica (COJ), adherence to the Electronic Transactions Act, and compliance with Jamaica’s Data Protection Act (2020). This regulatory gap creates legal risk and inhibits sustainable operation, particularly for micro-enterprises operating in semi-formal sectors.






Project Purpose and Justification
Our project, Jamaica’s Bridges in Business, addresses these barriers by developing an inclusive online marketplace tailored for sole traders. The platform will streamline legal compliance while providing accessible, efficient channels for entrepreneurs to promote their offerings. By bridging regulatory knowledge gaps and access to digital commerce, the solution aims to amplify visibility for local businesses, foster scalability, and cultivate a supportive ecosystem where Jamaican entrepreneurs, from students to seasoned traders,  have the opportunity to thrive.

Requirement #
	

	Use Case
	Define Data Retention Periods

	                                                         1. When a user account has been inactive beyond the defined system threshold, the system flags the account and after notifying the user, deletes the personal data.
                                                         2. Given log data older than the retention limit, when the automated purge process is run those logs are successfully deleted.

Requirement #
	

	Use Case
	Authenticate User
	Rationale

	User Requirement
	The system shall prompt users to authenticate themselves.
	System Requirements
	                                                         1. The system shall enforce a password policy at account creation and password change.
                                                         2. The system shall store user passwords using secure hashing.
                                                         3. The system shall implement rate-limiting on login attempts.
                                                         4. The system shall implement authenticated sessions to enable authorized actions within the system.
	Acceptance Criteria
	                                                         1. When a user attempts to set a weak password then the system should reject it with a message explaining the password requirements.
                                                         2. On inspecting the database, no plaintext passwords are stored.
                                                         3. Given a defined number of failed login attempts, the system imposes a delay to login again.

Requirement #
	

	Use Case
	Manage User Session
	Rationale
	Secured sessions and automatic session timeouts help protect used accounts from being hijacked.
	User Requirement
	The system shall keep authenticated sessions secured
	System Requirements
	                                                         1. The system shall automatically require re-authentication after a defined period of inactivity.
                                                         2. The system shall securely manage session tokens through the use of up-to-date encryption mechanisms and secure techniques such as Secure Cookies or JWT tokens
	Acceptance Criteria
	                                                         1. When an authenticated user remains idle beyond the set session timeout then any subsequent action requires re-authentication and the previous session token is invalidated.

	                                                         1. When a user requests a data export, the system should verify the user’s identity.
                                                         2. Given a user requests a data export and has authenticated themselves, the system generates a file containing all relevant personal data and makes it available for download.
                                                         3. Given a data export is available, the user receives a notification with a secure link to access the download.

Requirement #
	

	Use Case
	Delete Account
	Rationale
	The Data Protection Act (2020) requires that users be able to have their personal data erased when it’s no longer necessary for the purpose it was collected. Implementing account deletion gives us control and shows respect for their privacy choices.
	User Requirement
	The system shall allow users to fully delete their account and personal information from the platform.
	System Requirements
	                                                         1. The system shall provide a self-service account deletion option.
                                                         2. The system shall require re-authentication before an account deletion request is created.
                                                         3. The system shall remove all personal information relating to the user, with the exclusion of data needed for legal purposes.
	Acceptance Criteria
	                                                         1. When a user requests account deletion and confirms the action, then the system deletes the user’s account. Subsequent attempts to log in with that account fail,and the user’s personal data is no longer retrieved via the app or APIs.
